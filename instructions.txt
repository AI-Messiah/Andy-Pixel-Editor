You can just make a line or pixel and fill it with the line fill button.

When selecting a shape try to only select the pixels you want to fill, you can always go back and edit it more later.

The selected pixels are a part of the filling function.

For some image types saving is not supported but you can save it in another format with the save as button.

If the saving format does not support the alpha channel the color of the image will be whatever color settings were selected.
